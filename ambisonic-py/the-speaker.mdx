title: "Speaker"
description: "The core primitive for handling audio sources and spatial manipulation."
---

The `Speaker` class represents a single audio source within your soundstage. It handles loading audio files, converting them to mono for processing, and managing time-based spatial effects such as movement, azimuth, elevation, and distance.

```python
from ambisonicPy import Speaker
my_speaker = Speaker(track)
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="track" type="string" required>
  The file path to the audio track. This is loaded via `soundfile`. The class will automatically create a mono mix (`mono_track`) for processing while retaining the raw data.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lp_base" default="10000.0" type="float">
  The base cutoff frequency (in Hz) for the distance-dependent low-pass filter. This simulates air absorption as the object moves further away.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="lp_rolloff" default="1.0" type="float">
  Controls how aggressively the cutoff frequency drops as distance increases.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="distance_rolloff" default="1.0" type="float">
  A scalar multiplier for distance calculations. Kept primarily for compatibility.
</ParamField>

## Methods

### `add_effect`

Registers a spatial effect to occur over a specific time range.

```python
speaker.add_effect(time_range, effect)
```

<ParamField path="time_range" type="tuple" required>
  A tuple `(start_seconds, end_seconds)` defining when the effect is active.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="effect" type="dict" required>
  A dictionary defining the effect parameters.

  **Required keys for 'move':**

  - `type`: Can be any effect from Effects.
  - `start`: Tuple `(azimuth, elevation, distance)`.
  - `end`: Tuple `(azimuth, elevation, distance)`.

  _Note: Angles are in radians. Elevation is  for "front"._
</ParamField>

### `clear_effects`

Resets the speaker to its initial state.

```python
speaker.clear_effects()
```
