Effects in `ambisonicPy` define how a speaker moves or changes over time. They are applied using the `Speaker.add_effect()` method.

## Structure

An effect is defined as a Python dictionary. It must always include a `type` key, which tells the renderer which handler to use.

```python
{
    "type": "move",
    "start": (0, 1.57, 1.0),
    "end": (3.14, 1.57, 2.0)
}
```

## Available Effects

### Move

The `move` effect linearly interpolates the speaker's position from a starting point to an ending point over the specified time range.

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"move"`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="start" type="tuple" required>
  The starting position: `(azimuth, elevation, distance)`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="end" type="tuple" required>
  The ending position: `(azimuth, elevation, distance)`.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  **Coordinate System**:

  - **Azimuth**: Horizontal angle in radians ($0$ to $2\pi$).
  - **Elevation**: Vertical angle in radians ($\pi/2$ is directly in front/horizontal).
  - **Distance**: Scalar value (1.0 is standard distance).
